# Project **DASH-(Data Access Solution Hub)**

## Problem Statement
**DASH (Data Access Solution Hub)** is an AI-powered assistant designed for **grocery managers and non-technical users** who need quick access to business data but lack SQL or programming skills.

In most retail and grocery operations, critical data is scattered across **databases, Excel sheets, PDFs, and warehouse systems**, making it hard for non-technical teams to access insights without involving analysts or engineers.

**DASH solves this** by enabling users to ask **natural language questions** and receive instant **answers and reports**, all powered by AI and connected to multiple data sources in real time.
